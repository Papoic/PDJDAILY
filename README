I'm currently working on an experimental responsive web design which will adapt
depending on the available width of the viewport.

This means the view will automatically change depending if we're viewing this website
on a desktop machine or an mobile device like an iPhone/iPad.

If you want to see more examples of responsive web design, please visit http://responsive.is.

Thanks,
PDJ
